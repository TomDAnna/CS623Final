# CS623Final
CS623 Database Management Coding project

This code was developed in the python programming language for the CS623 Coding final. 

I first tried to create the code without deleting the tables and re creating them but I was receiving some errors because of some desrepencies with the foreign keys.

I deleted the databases and re created them in visual studio code. With Python being so simple, there is very little code to be implemented outside of the postgreSQL queries.
